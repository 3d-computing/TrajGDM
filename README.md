# TrajGDM
> This is the official Code for ***Simulating Human Mobility with a Generative Trajectory Generation Model.\***

## Datasets

Two datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the model. 

**T-Drive:** The dataset collected the real taxi GPS trajectory in Beijing, China. It contains the trajectory of 10,357 taxis during the period of Feb. 2 to Feb. 8, 2008. The average sample frequency is 2.95 minutes. Considering the data missing problem, we resampled the location of every taxi for every 5 minutes, so all trajectories in the dataset have a fixed time interval. We extracted the positioning points in the six-ring road, which account for 98.2% of all points in the dataset. Then the region in the six-ring road is divided into 27*27 grids by the square with 2000 meters edge length, which was decided by the mobility frequency and averaged moving distance in the dataset. Eventually, there are 169,984 trajectories recorded. 

**Geo-life:** The dataset was collected from 182 people. The GPS trajectories record their mobility activity over 5 years. We also resampled all trajectories into a 5 minutes time interval and extracted points in six-ring road. Considering the mobility activity is relatively weak, the division is set as 500 meters, so there are 110*110 grids in total. At last, there are 79,360 trajectories left.

## How to Run the Code

The training dataset is used for training the trajectory generating model and evaluate modelsâ€™ performance in generation. The testing dataset if used for evaluating the performance of zero-shot predicting and reconstructing. 

``` bash
1. Run runner/trainer.py to train a TrajGDM for T-Drive dataset. 
2. Run runner/trainer_geolife.py to train a TrajGDM for Geo-Life dataset.
3. Run runner/generation_eval.py to generate a synthesized trajectory dataset and evaluate its similarity with the real one using 5 metrics from the paper.
4. Run runner/zeroshot_eval.py to predict and reconstruct a trajectory with a trained TrajGDM model.
```
